## 🎯 Types of Contributions

### 🐛 Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:
- **Clear description** of the issue
- **Steps to reproduce** the problem
- **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
- **Environment details** (Node.js version, OS, etc.)
- **Minimal code example** demonstrating the issue

### 💡 Feature Requests

For new features, please provide:
- **Use case** description
- **Proposed API** design
- **Performance considerations**
- **Backward compatibility** impact

### 🔧 Code Contributions

#### Performance-Critical Guidelines

Since Zephyr Events is optimized for performance:

1. **Benchmark your changes** - Run performance tests
2. **Avoid breaking changes** to the core API
3. **Keep bundle size minimal** - Check output size
4. **Use ES2023 features** where beneficial
5. **Maintain type safety** - Full TypeScript support

#### Code Style

- **ES2023** syntax preferred
- **Minimal dependencies** - avoid external packages
- **Type safety** - use TypeScript properly
- **Performance first** - optimize for speed
- **Memory efficient** - avoid unnecessary allocations

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing

Create test files to verify your changes:

```javascript
const zephyrEvents = require('./dist/zephyr-events.js').default;

// Test your changes
const emitter = zephyrEvents();
// ... test logic
```

### Performance Testing

For performance-related changes:

```bash
# Run benchmark (if you have the benchmark script)
node benchmark.js
```

### Test Coverage Areas

- ✅ **Core functionality**: on/off/emit
- ✅ **Edge cases**: empty handlers, wildcard events
- ✅ **Memory management**: handler cleanup
- ✅ **TypeScript types**: type safety verification
- ✅ **Race conditions**: concurrent operations

## 📝 Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Build successfully**: `npm run build`
2. **Test your changes** thoroughly
3. **Check bundle sizes** in `dist/` folder
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Follow commit conventions**

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: add support for async event handlers
fix: resolve memory leak in handler cleanup
perf: optimize event emission for single handlers
docs: update API examples in README
```

### Pull Request Template

When submitting a PR, include:
