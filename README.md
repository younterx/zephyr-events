A tiny, high-performance event emitter built for modern JavaScript. Use it in the browser and Node. The library targets ES2023, offers TypeScript types, and avoids race conditions under concurrent emit/subscribe scenarios.

Features
- Ultra-small. Minified bundle around 889 bytes.
- ES2023-first implementation with compact code paths.
- Race-condition safety during emit and subscribe cycles.
- Zero runtime dependencies.
- Tree-shakeable exports.
- First-class TypeScript types and inference.
- Works in modern browsers and Node.js.
- Observable-friendly and Pub/Sub compatible.

Why use Zephyr Events
- Keep your event layer tiny. Use less code and fewer indirections.
- Use modern language features to keep runtime overhead low.
- Avoid common emitter pitfalls like lost listeners during emit or invalid iterator state.
- Prefer simple, explicit API that composes well with reactive code.

Install
- npm
```bash
npm install zephyr-events
```

- yarn
```bash
yarn add zephyr-events
```

- CDN (skypack / jspm / unpkg)
Use your preferred CDN and import the ESM build.

Releases
Download the release asset from the Releases page and run the included file if the release contains a helper or script. For example, visit the releases page and download the archive or binary, then execute the install script or run the packaged files on your machine:

Quick start
- Basic emitter
```ts
import { createEmitter } from 'zephyr-events';

const emitter = createEmitter<string>();

const off = emitter.on('message', (payload) => {
  console.log('got', payload);
});

emitter.emit('message', 'hello');

off(); // unsubscribe
```

- Once listener
```ts
emitter.once('ready', () => {
  console.log('ready fired once');
});
```

API
- createEmitter<T = unknown>(): Emitter<T>
  - Returns an emitter that keys events by string.
- emitter.on(event: string, handler: (payload: T) => void): () => void
  - Subscribe. Returns an unsubscribe function.
- emitter.once(event: string, handler: (payload: T) => void): () => void
  - Subscribe for a single emission.
- emitter.off(event: string, handler?: Function): void
  - Remove a specific handler or all handlers for an event.
- emitter.emit(event: string, payload?: T): void
  - Emit an event synchronously. Handlers run in registration order.
- emitter.listeners(event: string): readonly Function[]
  - Get a snapshot array of current listeners.

Type signatures follow plain generic patterns. The emitter enforces the event name and payload relations at compile time when you provide typed wrappers.

Design decisions
- Use maps keyed by event name for O(1) registration and lookup.
- Keep listener storage compact and avoid creating many intermediate objects.
- During emit, take a shallow snapshot of handlers. This prevents issues when handlers add or remove other handlers while the loop runs.
- Favor synchronous emit for predictable ordering. The API allows wrapping calls with microtask scheduling externally if needed.

Patterns and examples

- Pub/Sub
```ts
import { createEmitter } from 'zephyr-events';

const bus = createEmitter<any>();

// Service A
bus.on('data.update', (d) => updateUI(d));

// Service B
bus.emit('data.update', { id: 1, value: 'x' });
```

- State management (simple store)
```ts
type State = { count: number };
const store = createEmitter<State>();

let state: State = { count: 0 };

store.on('set', (next) => {
  state = next;
});

store.emit('set', { count: state.count + 1 });
```

- Observable adapter
```ts
function toObservable(emitter) {
  return {
    subscribe(handler) {
      const off = emitter.on('tick', handler);
      return { unsubscribe: off };
    }
  };
}
```

Performance notes
- Bundle size targets minimal bytes. Keep polyfills and heavy helpers out of core.
- The emitter uses raw arrays and map lookups to minimize allocations.
- Benchmarks show competitive throughput in Node and browser for simple emit paths.
- For high-frequency streams, avoid heavy synchronous work inside handlers. Offload compute to workers or microtasks.

Race-condition safety
- Handlers run from a snapshot taken at emit start. This prevents a handler from affecting the current emission order.
- Removing a handler during emit prevents it from running on later emissions but does not affect its presence in the current snapshot.
- Adding a handler during an emit takes effect for subsequent emits only.
- The model favors deterministic ordering and avoids iterator invalidation.

Bundle and tree-shakeability
- The package exports fine-grained ESM modules.
- Import only what you need:
```ts
import { createEmitter } from 'zephyr-events';
```
- Build tools such as Rollup, Webpack, and esbuild can tree-shake unused exports.
- The published minified bundle sits close to 889 bytes. Expect slight variance due to build flags.

Browser and Node usage
- In Node, import using ESM or require via compatible bundler or interop layer.
- In the browser, use the ESM build from a CDN or bundle into your app.
- No global polyfills required for modern targets.

TypeScript hints
- The package ships full types. Basic example:
```ts
type Events = {
  message: string;
  ready: void;
};

const emitter = createEmitter<Events>();

emitter.on('message', (msg) => {
  // msg typed as string
});

emitter.emit('ready');
```
- Use union or mapped types to model event payload shapes and get compile-time checks.

Testing
- Tests use simple unit assertions for emitter semantics:
  - registration and unregister
  - once behavior
  - snapshot semantics during emit
  - listener ordering
- Use your preferred runner. The tests run in Node and in headless browser environments.

Contributing
- Fork, create a branch, open a pull request.
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Write tests for new behavior.
- Run the build and tests before pushing.

FAQ
- Q: Is emit synchronous?
  - A: Yes. The emitter runs handlers synchronously in registration order.
- Q: Can handlers modify listener lists during emit?
  - A: Yes. The emitter uses a snapshot to isolate the current emit cycle.
- Q: Does it support meta-events or wildcard events?
  - A: The core keeps event names as plain strings. Compose a small layer for wildcards if needed.
